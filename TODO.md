# TO DO
- [ ] Write datagen for deposit structures instead of using a dynamic pack.
- [ ] Implement a create mod bearing for a multiblock contraption that acts as a drill.
  - [ ] Where does the yield go? If it goes into the contraption inventory, the item extraction becomes awkward and unnatural.
  - [ ] How would the drill look? What shape? Which blocks would it be built from?
- [ ] Integration with map mods.
  - [ ] Record visited deposits per-player into persistent storage.
  - [ ] Show scanned deposits as icons on the map.
- [ ] Add deposits for metals/gems from other mods.
- [ ] Store deposits known to player on client side. Sync with server for accurate scanning.
- [ ] Figure out how to publish on curseforge/modrinth.
- [ ] Figure out how to autoincrement semver and auto-publish to curseforge/modrinth.
- [ ] Port to Fabric.
