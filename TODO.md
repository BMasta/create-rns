# TO DO
- [x] Implement algorithms to fairly distribute ore chunks around the world.
- [ ] Basic integration with create mod.
  - [x] Dependency version management and gradle options.
  - [x] Miner accepts create mod rotation and generates stress when working.
  - [x] Miner shows goggle tooltip.
  - [x] Miner has an animated model with spinning shaft when working.
  - [ ] Miner only works when supplied with sufficient stress and rotation speed.
  - [ ] Miner tooltip shows stress impact
- [ ] Add ore chunk locator item that can tune onto an ore type among available ores and scan for the nearest ore chunk of that type.
- [ ] Miner makes sound when working
- [ ] Miner emits particles when working
- [ ] Handle client/server config
  - [ ] Add config variable for picking an ore distribution algorithm.
  - [ ] Add config variable for allowed ores, how common their ore chunks should be, and how much ore is yielded on each excavation.
  - [ ] Add config variable for recomputing ore chunk data on existing chunks when they are loaded.
  - [ ] Add config variable for chunk purities and their corresponding excavation time.
- [ ] Add recipes for all items.
- [ ] Integration with JEI.
- [ ] Add sound to miner when it's running
- [ ] Explore data generator usage for resource generation when possible.
- [ ] Add in-game commands.
  - [ ] Teleport to a desired ore chunk or show its coordinates (admin).
  - [ ] Generate an ore chunk with specified properties.
- [ ] Add multiple tiers of miners with improved mining speed.
- [ ] Implement a create mod bearing for a multiblock contraption that acts as a drill.
  - [ ] What does the "drill" drill? Air? Should there spawn a physical ore pile in ore chunks? (also applies to basic miner).
  - [ ] Where does the yield go? If it goes into the contraption inventory, the item extraction becomes awkward and unnatural.
- [ ] Integration with map mods.
  - [ ] Show scanned ore chunks as custom waypoints.
