# TO DO
- [ ] Use recipes to define yield for each deposit block.
- [ ] Scale deposit progress with number of same deposit blocks instead of yield count.
- [ ] Replace miner menu with enhanced create tooltip. Obtain mined items with right click.
- [ ] Handle client/server config
  - [ ] Add config variable for base mining speed of miners.
- [ ] Add recipes for all items.
- [ ] Integration with JEI.
- [ ] Add multiple tiers of miners with improved mining speed.
- [ ] Implement a create mod bearing for a multiblock contraption that acts as a drill.
  - [ ] Where does the yield go? If it goes into the contraption inventory, the item extraction becomes awkward and unnatural.
- [ ] Integration with map mods.
  - [ ] Record visited deposits per-player into persistent storage.
  - [ ] Show scanned deposits as icons on the map.
- [ ] Add a deposit for zinc.
- [ ] Add deposits for metals/gems from other mods.
- [ ] Add ponders.
- [ ] Figure out how to build and run the release version of the mod.
- [ ] Figure out how to publish on curseforge/modrinth.
- [ ] Figure out how to autoincrement semver and auto-publish to curseforge/modrinth.
- [ ] Port to 1.21.x (Neoforge?).
