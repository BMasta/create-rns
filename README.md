Scan for rocks, mine out stones! **Create: Rock & Stone** aims to close the gap between Create and traditional factory game experience by bringing infinite mineable resource deposits into the world.

# Features

Used to scan for underground ore deposits. Once you tuned onto a deposit, its antennas will periodically flash. If both antennas flash together, you are looking in the right direction. The faster they flash, the closer you are! <br> <br>

Mines resources from an underground deposit in a 3x3x1 area below. A deposit block can be claimed by only one miner at a time. The more deposit blocks a miner claims, the faster it mines the resource of that type. <br> <br>
